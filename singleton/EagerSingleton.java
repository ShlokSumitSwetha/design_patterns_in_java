/*If your singleton class is not using a lot of resources, 
this is the approach to use. But in most of the scenarios, 
Singleton classes are created for resources such as File System, 
Database connections etc and we should avoid the instantiation 
until unless client calls the getInstance method. Also this method 
doesn�t provide any options for exception handling.
